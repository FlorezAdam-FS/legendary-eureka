# Welcome to my Stock App

I used an API from polygon.io. I pulled historical data for a stock as well as the logo for that stock using two different urls . I used a date picker for you to choose dates, once you add a symbol (i.e. AAPL, GOOGL, FB. NFLX) you will get the historical open and close data for each of the dates.
